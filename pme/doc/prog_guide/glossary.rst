Glossary
========


ACL
   Access Control List

API
   Application Programming Interface

ASLR
   Linux* kernel Address-Space Layout Randomization

BSD
   Berkeley Software Distribution

Clr
   Clear

CIDR
   Classless Inter-Domain Routing

Control Plane
   The control plane is concerned with the routing of packets and with
   providing a start or end point.

Core
   A core may include several lcores or threads if the processor supports
   hyperthreading.

Core Components
   A set of libraries provided by the DPDK, including eal, ring, mempool,
   mbuf, timers, and so on.

CPU
   Central Processing Unit

CRC
   Cyclic Redundancy Check

Data Plane
   In contrast to the control plane, the data plane in a network architecture
   are the layers involved when forwarding packets.  These layers must be
   highly optimized to achieve good performance.

DIMM
   Dual In-line Memory Module

Doxygen
   A documentation generator used in the DPDK to generate the API reference.

DPDK
   Data Plane Development Kit

DRAM
   Dynamic Random Access Memory

Socket
   A physical CPU, that includes several *cores*.

RTE
   Run Time Environment. Provides a fast and simple framework for fast packet
   processing, in a lightweight environment as a Linux* application and using
   Poll Mode Drivers (PMDs) to increase speed.
