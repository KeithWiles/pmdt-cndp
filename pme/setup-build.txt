# The PME setup instructions are draft only text and will need to be improved.
# Please report any issues with the setup and build instructions or supply a 
# patch to update these instructions.

# On Ubuntu 19.10 install the following packages
sudo apt install libbsd-dev libpcap-dev python3-pip pkg-config ninja-build

# Ninja needs to be at least version 1.9.0
# Meson needs to be at least version 0.51.2

git clone https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson.git

# install meson with python3
python3 setup.py install

# Install Go do not use apt-get as that is an older version
# get the correct tar file from https://golang.org/dl/ and follow the instructions
# I picked 1.13.7 release go1.13.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz but a newer version will work too
# look at the site below for the latest version of Go
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Setup GOPATH to some location $HOME/go is one place

# The current process info patch is in the patches directory.
# Apply the patch to the 20.02-rc1 release of DPDK and build dpdk plus your application.
# The patch is named process-info-dpdk-20.02.patch

cd perfmon/pcm
make

# install the standard Linux MSR module
sudo modprobe msr

# The script will run and create the mmap region for PME to access.
# The script does not put the daemon in the background
./doit

# In a new xterm execute the pme tool. The pme_run script will build PME and execute it.
# Note: Need to have an xterm with around 132 characters wide and 46 or more rows.

cd perfmon/pme
./pme_run

# at this point you should have the tool running and using the function keys you
# can display the different screens and data.

TODO: More details and instructions to be added.
