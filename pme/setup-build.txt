# The PME setup instructions are draft only text and will need to be improved.
# Please report any issues with the setup and build instructions or supply a
# patch to update these instructions.

# On Ubuntu 19.10 and 20.04 install the following packages
sudo apt install libbsd-dev libpcap-dev python3-pip pkg-config meson ninja-build

# Ninja needs to be at least version 1.10.0 as of 2020-07 in ubuntu 20.04
# Meson needs to be at least version 0.53.2 as of 2020-07 in ubuntu 20.04

# Install Go do not use apt-get as that is an older version
# get the correct tar file from https://golang.org/dl/ and follow the instructions
# I picked 1.13.7 release go1.13.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz but a newer version will work too
# look at the site below for the latest version of Go as of 2020-07 version 1.14.3 is
# available to use for PMDT.

# updated to 1.14.3 as of 2020-07
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Setup GOPATH to some location $HOME/go is one place follow the setup instructions
# for Go and verify it is working.

# Download the PMDT source code.

git clone http://dpdk.org/git/apps/pmdt

# PMDT needs opcm to provide system information, which needs to be downloaded.
# Download the code via git from git@github.com:opcm/pcm.git

cd pmdt
git clone git@github.com:opcm/pcm.git opcm
cd opcm

# Need to checkout an older version to get PME to build
git co -b v202003 202003

# The current DPDK version used by PMDT is 20.05 release, please download and use
# this version with PMDT to work correctly.
# Note: In the pmdt/pme/patches directory contains a patch for DPDK 19.11 and backports
#       the new DPDK telemetry library to this version of DPDK.

cd pmdt/pme/pcm-info
meson build
ninja -C build

# install the standard Linux MSR module
sudo modprobe msr

# The following script at pmdt/pme/pme_run will run and create the local domain socket.
# The script does not put the daemon in the background
./run_pcm

# In a new xterm execute the pme tool. The pme_run script will build PME and execute it.
# Note: Need to have an xterm with around 132 characters wide and 46 or more rows.

cd pmdt/pme
./pme_run

# at this point you should have the tool running and using the function keys you
# can display the different screens and data.
# After you build applications using DPDK 20.05 and execute these applications you will
# see the tools locating the DPDK applications and displaying the data provided.

TODO: More details and instructions to be added .
