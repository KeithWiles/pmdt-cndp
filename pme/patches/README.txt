The current DPDK 19.11 patch in this directory backports the 20.05 telemetry library
to DPDK to allow PMDT to work with DPDK 19.11. The patch was created for OVS and this
patch will be removed as DPDK-OVS moves to 20.5 release of DPDK. Other patches are not
planned at this time and the goal of PMDT is not to provide patches.
